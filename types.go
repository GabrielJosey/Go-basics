/*
1) int, int8, int16, int32, int64   The lower the int# the smaller a number you can keep stored.
int# can store both positive and negative numbers
2)uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64     uint# can only hold positive numbers
unless you have a specific reason to use uint# then its probably not worth using
3) float32, float64     for floating point numbers, that is numbers with a decimal point
you will want to use the float32 or float64 types
